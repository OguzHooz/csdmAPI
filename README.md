# csdmAPI

The [CS Demo Manager CLI](https://cs-demo-manager.com/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) need to be installed in order for the API to work.


## todo
- [X] Fix run commands
- [ ] Fix long load times due to big JSON files
- [X] Fix API return type (currently returns text/plain)
